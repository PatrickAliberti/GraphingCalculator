A simple graphing calculator made with the SFML library

This application contains a Window class which sets the graph's background, axes, and function plot using SFML for the graphics and Jesse Brown's shunting-yard program 
(http://www.daniweb.com/software-development/cpp/code/427500/calculator-using-shunting-yard-algorithm#) with modifications by Brandon Amos (https://github.com/tesch1/cpp-expression-parser) for parsing the mathematical 
expressions.
