A simple graphing calculator made with the SFML library

This application contains a Window class which sets the graph's background, axes, and function plot using SFML for the graphics and Jesse Brown's shunting-yard program (http://www.daniweb.com/software-development/cpp/code/427500/calculator-using-shunting-yard-algorithm#) for parsing the mathematical expressions.
